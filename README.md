# The Twelve Viking Factors

###### The 12 factors to successfully deploying a war campaign in production.

1. Codebase
- A collection of source codes we use to define our code of honor in war.

2. Dependencies
- The only one a warrior should depend on is himself.

3. Config
- Beware artifical figs, they are often made with soil and do not taste very good.

4. Backing Services
- Supply lines are a deciding factor in war, do not be cut off from your boats and thus your way home.

5. Build, release, run
- Our training motto. Build your defenses, release your anger, and run at the enemy

6. Processes
- Execute an invasion as one or more stateless processes. Your warriors can asynchronously breach walls to keep the enemy confused.

7. Port binding
- Take enemy ports to store boats during wartime and export your goods back home.

8. Concurrency
- Attacking multiple targets simultaneously can prevent their preparation.

9. Disposability
- Do not invade that which you can not clean after, disease is no joke.

10. Dev/prod parity
- Through the entire lifecycle, be sure your plan does not change from development through the staging of your resources and through the deployment of troops.

11. Logs
- Our most important wartime economic factor; builds ships, weapons, and homes

12. Admin processes
- Administration and management of a fighting force should be done by a singular general or commander.
